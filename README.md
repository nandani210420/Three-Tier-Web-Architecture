A three-tier web architecture separates an application into three logical and physical computing tiers:

Web Tier: The user-facing layer (e.g., Nginx with React.js) that serves the website and redirects API calls. An external load balancer distributes incoming client traffic.
Application Tier: The middle layer (e.g., Node.js) that processes business logic, handles API requests, and interacts with the database. An internal load balancer manages traffic from the web tier.
Database Tier: The backend layer (e.g., Aurora MySQL Multi-AZ) that stores and retrieves all application data, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
Key Components & Functionality:

Load Balancers: Distribute traffic to prevent bottlenecks and ensure high availability.
Health Checks: Continuously monitor instance health to ensure only operational instances receive traffic.
Auto Scaling Groups: Automatically adjust instance count based on load for performance and cost efficiency.
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): Manages SSL/TLS certificates for secure, encrypted communication (HTTPS).
Amazon Route 53: Manages DNS records and directs user traffic to the appropriate resources.
This architecture enhances scalability, reliability, and availability by distributing loads, monitoring health, and dynamically scaling resources.
